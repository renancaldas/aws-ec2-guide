### 1. Creating the AWS EC2 instance 
---
You should have an [AWS](aws.amazon.com) registration. They give a free year of VPS server! üòÉ 

- Login into your AWS account and choose EC2 in AWS dashboard:

- Click in the "Launch Instance" button:

- Select **Ubuntu Server**

    ![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/renancaldas/aws-ec2-guide/master/img/03.png)

- Choose **"t2.micro"** tier, click on **"Review and Launch"** button

    ![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/renancaldas/aws-ec2-guide/master/img/04.png)

- Then click on **"Launch"** button, which will open a poup asking for a key pair creation. Choose **"Create a new key pair"**, name it, **download** it and then click on **"Launch instances"**.

    ![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/renancaldas/aws-ec2-guide/master/img/05.png)

- Finally, your server will be initialized! Obs.: Copy and paste the **"Public DNS"** or **"Public IP"** in a separated document for further instructions! üìù

    ![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/renancaldas/aws-ec2-guide/master/img/07.png)

- Next, you should open the some ports in order to expose your server to external requests from the internet. Click on the link close to **"Security groups"**, from the previous picture. Then add the **inbound** request ports **80, 22 and 443**, clicking on **"Edit"** button,  as the follow image:

- Now you are ready for connecting to your server! üëç

### 2. Connecting to server and initializing it
---
I will be using bash commands (Mac or Linux). For Windows, [check this out](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about). So I think you should be fine... Please give me a feedback on this.

1. Open **terminal** and connect via ssh to your server. Obs.: here we need the ***"Public DNS"*** or ***"Public IP"*** and the **key pair file** (.pem) mentioned before.
    ```
        $ chmod 400 [path to .pem file]
        $ ssh ubuntu@[your server ip or dns] -i [path to .pem file]
    ```

2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (in this example, version 6):
    ```
        $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
        $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```


3. Set npm path to user's home and install packages: [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/), [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    ```
        $ npm config set prefix ~/npm
        $ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin"
    
        $ npm install pm2 -g
        $ pm2 startup       
            // If show "You have to run this command as root", run the given command!
        
        $ npm install nodemon -g
        $ sudo apt install git
    ```
4. Store NPM path in user's profile file. This will keep the previous NPM changes.
    ```
        $ nano ~/.profile
        
        // Add these lines at the end: 
        # set NPM path to user's home
        npm config set prefix ~/npm
        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin"
        
        // Save it using: CTRL + o, ENTER
        // And exit using: CTRL + x, ENTER
    ```

5. Store your Git user credentials. This will prevent the login prompt when using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commands.
    ```
        $ nano ~/.netrc
        
        // And add these lines:
        machine github.com (or bitbucket.org)
        login [YOUR_USER]
        password [YOUR_PASS]
        
        // Save it using: CTRL + o, ENTER
        // And exit using: CTRL + x, ENTER
    ```

    
&nbsp;

### 3. Nginx
---
Here we will install Nginx, configure it to router external requests from port 80 (remember that we have open this port before?) to server's local port 3000, which could be a NodeJS application running in this port. We will setup a NodeJS application in next step.

- First, install nginx:
    ```
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

- Then we need to edit the config default file in order to forward requests:
    ```
        $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        
        // In "server" block, put a # character at these lines:
        # root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        # index index.html index.htm;
        
        // Clear everything inside "location /" block , and set it like this
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;           
        }
        
        // Save it using: CTRL + o, ENTER
        // And exit using: CTRL + x, ENTER
    ```
    It should look like this:
    ![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/renancaldas/aws-ec2-guide/master/img/10.png)
    

- And reload Nginx with new configuration redirecting requests from port 80 (http) to local port 3000
    ```
        $ sudo service nginx restart
    ```

### 4. Git Hook Listener
---
This is a project that I have done in order to use the continuous deployment concept that automatizes the process of uploading project files to multiple servers and environments. This is a daily used component in the companies that I have worked.

**Please continue by reading the [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/renancaldas/git-hook-listener), like this one.**
